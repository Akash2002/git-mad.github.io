  bio: Hey! I'm a second year CS Major and I am one of your Co-Presidents of GITMAD! I'm truly excited to be able to help improve this club! Last semester, I was the Events Coordinator and I was able to set up many Android-related Tech Talks with big companies such as Microsoft, State Farm, Capital One, UPS, and more! I have many plans for this club, including improving the curriculum by making it less complicating, as well as many more Tech talks throughout the year (so make sure to bring your resumes). Join us if you want to start learning Android!

  bio: Hello, I’m Fuad. I’m a CS and Chinese major. I founded and worked on my high school’s app team and work at Neopod currently. I’m most experienced in Java but have been trying to use Kotlin recently. I enjoy hackathons and have been trying to get into teaching.  My main interests are in how the user should be interacting with the app and project design/management. Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to talk!

  bio: Hey! I'm Jason, a third-year CS major (Intelligence-People) at Tech. I love Android development (been gettting into Flutter recently) and hackathons. You'll often find me with Android Studio open at weird hours of the night, or pestering friends for feedback on a feature. I've worked at NCR (if you've ever been to Waffle House, you've used my code!), Amazon (Amazon's Choice), and am involved in the startup scene. I've been teaching for more than four years. Feel free to shoot me an email or grab a coffee with me!

  bio: Hey! I'm Jason, a third-year CS major (Intelligence-People) at Tech. I love Android development and hackathons. You'll often find me with Android Studio open at weird hours of the night, or pestering friends for feedback on a feature. I've worked at NCR (if you've ever been to Waffle House, you've used my code!), and am involved in the startup scene. I've been teaching for more than four years. Feel free to contact me about anything!

  bio: Yo! I’m Drake, a second year CS major. I’m super excited to be an officer! I’ve previously instructed kid’s coding courses for over two years, interned at Google, and helped make one of the sickest Android ports of Space Trader. I’m passionate about learning new things, especially in the mobile world. Let’s make something cool!

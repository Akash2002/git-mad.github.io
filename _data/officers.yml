  bio: Hi I'm Jamal, I am a CS major at Tech! I joined GITMAD in Fall 2016, became an officer in Spring 2018, and became Co-President in May 2019. I am very interested in Android development, and I want to spread the knowledge! In the past I have mentored Android develoers at HackGT, HackGTeeny, and GIT MAD's Appathon, and I hope to teach more in the future. I primarily use Java, but I am learning Kotlin, and I have recently taken an interest in cross-platform frameworks like Flutter and React Native.

  bio: Hello! I'm a first year CS Major and I'm super excited to be an officer! Although I do not have much experience in Android, I learned so much through this club and I'm excited to learn even more as an officer. I'm interested in UI/UX as well as Design. I can't wait to help organize what this club will do in the next semesters, from lessons, projects, bootcamps, tech talks, and much more!

  bio: Hey! I'm Jason, a second-year CS major (Intelligence-People) at Tech. I love Android development and hackathons. You'll often find me with Android Studio open at weird hours of the night, or pestering friends for feedback on a feature. I've worked at NCR (if you've ever been to Waffle House, you've used my code!), and am involved in the startup scene. I've been teaching for more than four years. Feel free to contact me about anything!

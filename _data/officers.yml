  position: Tech Lead
  bio: Hey! I'm Jason, a second-year CS major (Intelligence-People) at Tech. I love Android development and hackathons. You'll often find me with Android Studio open at weird hours of the night, or pestering friends for feedback on a feature. I've worked at NCR (if you've ever been to Waffle House, you've used my code!), and am involved in the startup scene. I've been teaching for more than four years. Feel free to contact me about anything!
